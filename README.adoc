= Visur

VI Surpassed => Visur

a powerful vim-like editor which extends vim to handle concepts that could only previously be handled well by a full integrated dev environment tool.

### Current Visur Features

1. **Quantums**: Defines cursor boundaries and search scopes. Implementations include:
   - **Character**: Cursor moves one character at a time.
   - **Regex (Word)**: Searches using regex patterns.
   - **Line (Wrapped)**: Moves between wrapped lines.
   - **Document**: Navigates through the entire document.

2. **Modes and Submodes**: Modes encapsulate commands; submodes allow temporary command changes. Supported modes:
   - **Navigate (Normal)**: General navigation commands.
   - **Insert**: For typing input.
   - **Replace**: Replaces existing text. 
   - Submodes include commands like `quantumStart`, `searchForward`, and `changeScope`, allowing for granular control during editing.

3. **Words**: Parts of **VisurCommand** strings categorized into:
   - **LiteralNumber** and **LiteralString**: Inputs for variable assignments.
   - **Assignment**: Sets variables based on preceding literal types.
   - **NativeOp**: Refers to operators in the current keymap.
	 - **Recall**: Fetches variables by name.

4. **Commands**: Strings of words executed in a reverse-polish notation manner, managed by the CommandCompileService for efficient parsing and execution.

5. **Operators**: Functionality invoked by `nativeWordOp` to modify the editor model's state, executed through the CommandExecutionService using values from the `executionDataStack`.

6. **Cursor Movement**: Supports both horizontal and vertical movement across all quantums, facilitating precise navigation.

7. **Deletion**: Deletes text within the cursor selection for all quantums, enhancing text editing capabilities.

8. **Typing**: Full support for user input anywhere in the document, allowing smooth text addition. `i` and `a` move to beginning and end quantum before insertion, respectively

9. **Spans 0-1**: Indicates how many quantums the cursor occupies. A span of 0 collapses the cursor into a thin line, akin to insert mode in Vim.

10. **Replacing**: Functions like Vimâ€™s replace mode. Allows text replacement but does not currently undo replacement changes with backspacing.

11. **QuantumStart/End**: Submodes for navigating to the first or last instance of a smaller quantum within a larger one, changing cursor positions based on quantum bounds.

12. **Searching**: Enters searchForward or searchBackward submodes for finding matches, moving the cursor to the first occurrence within scope.

13. **Repeat Last Search**: Implements movement to next or previous search results, starting from the current cursor position. (Behaves like `n` and `N` in vim).

14. **Scope Changing**: Users can modify the search scope dynamically to any of the supported quantums, making search operations flexible.

### Future Visur Features:
1. Edit objects not just text files. Type-sensitive editor. Because of that, it is also language-independent
2. Client-server architetures. Multiple users can edit the same files at the same time. Like Google Docs
3. Conditional logic & arithmetic operation within macro definition (imagine having if statements in vim macros & movements)
4. Interface independent. Can be used in the browser, command line, or within a graphical window
5. Can edit streams of data instead of just static files. For example, a network flow. Can work like a network analysis tool, capturing data in the moment
