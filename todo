design a distinction between regular quantum movement view (NormalView?) and filesystem navigation (FilesystemView?)
implement the distinction noted above (probably in ModelWasChangedVerticle?)
make FileQuantum
make DirectoryQuantum
implement filesystems (big one) by letting files be read from and written to (make it basic at first)
